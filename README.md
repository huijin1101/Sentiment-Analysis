3. **Feature Engineering and EDA**:
   - Introduced new features and explored their relationships with sentiment labels.
4. **Scalable ML Pipeline**:
   - Developed a robust ML pipeline integrating feature transformations and predictive models.
5. **End-to-End Workflow**:
   - Automated the sentiment prediction workflow from data ingestion to visualization.
   - Integrated predictions with AWS services (S3, Athena and QuickSight) for real-time insights via interactive dashboards.

## Results
- Best model: Logistic Regression achieving **80% accuracy**.
- Interactive dashboard enabled efficient exploration of sentiment trends across time and other variables:

  - 0, 1, 2 represent Negative, Neutral, Positive sentiment respectively.
  - The first row of images shows the distribution of sentiments in the dataset, highlighting the proportions of each sentiment category.
  - The first image in the second row illustrates the relationship between tweet word count and sentiment. It reveals that neutral tweets tend to have fewer words compared to negative and positive sentiments.
  - The second image in the second row depicts the proportion of predicted sentiments within each actual sentiment category, providing insights into the prediction accuracy for each sentiment class.. 
## Conclusion
This project highlights the power of distributed computing with Spark for large-scale sentiment analysis. By combining Databricks' capabilities with AWS services, we delivered a scalable, end-to-end pipeline from data ingestion to visualization. The approach can be extended to various NLP tasks, making it a valuable template for real-world applications.
